Features:
- Drop Down menu support
- Auto Fill / Password Manager
	- Keyboard has to feature this mode
- New DOM node types (inclusive abstract superclass)
	- Checkboxes
	- HTML5 Video Player support (replace tab bar with controlls and dim everything)
		- Page fullscreen handling -> for video would be cool to replace tab bar with video controls and for all: escape from fullscreen
	- DOM Node boxes for images are only text height
- Activate Sandbox on Application Side

Furthermore:
- Word prediction improvement (and add typed words) and make extra one for URL Input
- Daniel: Copy URL (from links and images)
- Inkognito
- Search on page
- Https recognition and displaying of lock
- CSS Injection
- Right click and _own_ context menus (see JS Window Object)
	- (Javascript Popup Handling)
- z-Layering of (fixed, text input) DOM elements (like Google.com)
- DOM Nodes of image have incorrect rectangle

Additional ideas:
- Emulate each keyboard key pressed on keyboard and show text, already filled in input field, and show temporary search results etc. as they appear
- Button for form submit? Emulating 'Enter' doesn't always submit a form
	-> Advanced form handling? e.g. check if all required fields are filled
